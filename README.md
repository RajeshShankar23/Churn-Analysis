# Churn-Analysis
## Problem
The problem you will be working on in this case study is customer churn. You'll be using a fictitious churn dataset from a Telecom provider called Databel. You are hired as a consultant, and your task is to analyse why customers are churning, or in other words, leaving Databel. "The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. The simplified formula for churn is to divide customers lost by the total number of customers. If we have a total of 100 customers in a certain period, and 10 end up leaving, we have a churn rate of 10%. There are multiple methods to calculate churn, and depending on the industry, it might make sense for a company to slightly alter the formula. A traditional e-commerce platform might consider a certain customer a churner if he or she hasn't made a purchase in the last 12 months.
The Databel dataset consists of 29 different columns and has one row per customer. You'll be analysing a snapshot of the database at a specific moment in time, meaning there is no time dimension.
The dataset contains numerous dimensions, the first one being Customer_id. The Customer_id is a unique ID that identifies an individual customer. The second column is called Churn Label, and it indicates if a customer churned with "Yes" and "No" labels. The dataset contains various other dimensions, such as demographic fields and information about premium plans.
