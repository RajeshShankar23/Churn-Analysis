# Churn-Analysis
## Business Problem
The problem you will be working on in this case study is customer churn. You'll be using a fictitious churn dataset from a Telecom provider called Databel. You are hired as a consultant, and your task is to analyse why customers are churning, or in other words, leaving Databel. "The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. The simplified formula for churn is to divide customers lost by the total number of customers. If we have a total of 100 customers in a certain period, and 10 end up leaving, we have a churn rate of 10%. There are multiple methods to calculate churn, and depending on the industry, it might make sense for a company to slightly alter the formula. A traditional e-commerce platform might consider a certain customer a churner if he or she hasn't made a purchase in the last 12 months.
The Databel dataset consists of 29 different columns and has one row per customer. You'll be analysing a snapshot of the database at a specific moment in time, meaning there is no time dimension.
The dataset contains numerous dimensions, the first one being Customer_id. The Customer_id is a unique ID that identifies an individual customer. The second column is called Churn Label, and it indicates if a customer churned with "Yes" and "No" labels. The dataset contains various other dimensions, such as demographic fields and information about premium plans.

## Analytical Approach:

Data Check: Ensuring data integrity by verifying counts of customer IDs and unique customer IDs.

Churn Calculation: Calculating churn rate based on the number of churned customers.

Reasons for Churn Investigation: Identifying top reasons for churn such as competitive factors, customer service issues, price sensitivity, and product dissatisfaction.

Churn Category Analysis: Grouping churn reasons into categories and analyzing churn distribution among these categories.

Churn Rate by State: Investigating regional disparities in churn rates to understand the impact of market competitiveness and customer demographics.

Demographic Analysis: Analyzing churn rates among different demographic groups, particularly focusing on age and gender.

Group Contracts Analysis: Examining the impact of group contracts on churn rates and phone bills.

Contract Type Analysis: Comparing churn rates between monthly and yearly contracts, along with gender disparities.

Customer Service Improvement: Exploring the impact of payment method, contract type, and customer tenure on churn rates and customer service calls.

## Insights:

Churn Factors: Competitive offerings, customer service quality, pricing, and product dissatisfaction are key factors influencing churn.

Regional Variations: Churn rates vary significantly across states, indicating the influence of market dynamics and customer preferences.

Demographic Trends: Seniors exhibit higher churn rates, while younger age groups show lower churn rates.

Contract Type Impact: Monthly contracts tend to have higher churn rates compared to yearly contracts, suggesting the importance of contract stability.

International Plans: Customers with international plans show varied churn rates based on international activity, emphasizing the need for targeted retention strategies.

Customer Service Calls: Higher customer service calls correlate with higher churn rates, especially among customers with monthly contracts and direct debit payments.

## Conclusion and Recommendations:
